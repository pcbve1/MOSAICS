# write the code to: 
# get atom_xyz from coordinates
# add the atom_xyz into the mosaics simulator object
# instantiate the simulator.
# ideally, you'd:
#   Start with your list of pdb files and pixel sizes
#   instantiate the simulator for each and iterate over that. 
#   so separate sim objects for each chain are needed. idk how but I'll do it
